# wallpaper_calendar
Put a calendar on your wallpaper
* This is a Python program which generates and sets a wallpaper with a calendar overlay (See wallpaper.jpg for a sample!)
* Currently only fully supports Windows (it generates a wallpaper on all systems, but can only automatically set it on Windows)

## Instructions
1. Make a venv in the install directory
2. ```pip install -r requirements.txt``` in that directory
3. Change the variables in the main.pyw file
4. Run it (Recommendation: Use Task Scheduler to run this program automatically)
